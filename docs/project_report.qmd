# 1. Introduction

This project analyzes Facebook posts from women's organizations to understand how content features influence audience engagement.  
The dataset includes **textual content**, **media information**, and **engagement metrics** (likes, shares, comments), as well as **page-level metadata** such as organization type, number of followers, and verification status.

The main research goals are:

- To **identify features** of Facebook posts that contribute to higher engagement.
- To analyze **sentiment patterns** in post text and organization descriptions.
- To develop a **neural network model** that predicts engagement based on post characteristics.

# 2. Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following types of information:

- **Post Metadata**: Date, time, type (photo, video, link, status)
- **Text Content**: Title, caption, description, message
- **Engagement Metrics**: Number of likes, shares, comments
- **Page Metadata**: Account name, handle, category, description, creation date, subscriber count, verification status
- **Custom Labels**: Organization category (e.g., feminist org, community group)
- **Media Info**: Links or references to images, videos, or external pages

A detailed **data dictionary** is available in `docs/data_dictionary.md`.

# 3. Analysis Plan

## 3.1 Data Cleaning (R)
- Standardize date and time formats.
- Handle missing values and inconsistent text encoding.
- Normalize categorical values (e.g., standardize `type` labels).
- Remove duplicate posts.

## 3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- **Missingness Analysis**: Identify patterns of missing data across columns.
- **Distribution Checks**: Count of post types, engagement ranges, posting time patterns.
- **Visualization**: Histograms, bar charts, and time-series trends.

## 3.3 Sentiment Analysis (Python)
- Apply sentiment analysis to:
  - **`message` column**: Main post text.
  - **`account.pageDescription` column**: Organization’s “about” section.
- Metrics to extract:
  - **Polarity** (positive to negative scale)
  - **Subjectivity** (objective vs. subjective tone)
- Store sentiment scores as new columns for modeling.

## 3.4 Predictive Modeling with Neural Networks (R)
- **Target Variable**: Engagement level (likes, shares, comments — combined or separate).
- **Features**:
  - Post type
  - Posting time
  - Text sentiment scores
  - Page metadata (followers, verification, category)
- **Approach**:
  - Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Use feed-forward neural network with appropriate activation functions.
  - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
  - Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, MAE, RMSE (depending on regression/classification framing).

## 3.5 Documentation & Reporting
- Maintain a **data dictionary** (`.md` format) for transparency.
- This Quarto report documents:
  - Data sources and processing steps
  - Analytical methods
  - Modeling workflow
  - Key findings and visualizations

# 4. Expected Outcomes

Through this analysis, we expect to:

1. Identify which **content features** (e.g., sentiment, type, time) correlate with higher engagement.
2. Understand **sentiment tendencies** in posts and page descriptions.
3. Develop a **predictive model** to estimate post engagement.
4. Provide **practical recommendations** for women’s organizations to enhance their social media strategy.

# 5. Tools and Technologies

- **R**: Data cleaning, neural network modeling  
- **Python**: Sentiment analysis, EDA  
- **Quarto**: Documentation and reporting  
- **Markdown**: Data dictionary and supplementary notes

# 6. Next Steps

- Finalize data preprocessing scripts.
- Complete sentiment analysis pipeline.
- Train and evaluate neural network model.
- Integrate results into visualizations for stakeholder interpretation.
- Publish final report with actionable insights.
